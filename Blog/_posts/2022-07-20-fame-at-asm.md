The Edwards and Dinsdale labs enjoyed a wonderful trip to Sydney to attend and present at the 
Australian Society for Microbiology's annual conference. 
FAMEous researches enjoyed many inspiring and exiting talks from many Microbiologists across Australia and from overseas.

Day 1 opened with some great public lectures at the Australian National Maritime Museum,
followed by the ASM awards and orations. 
The day ended with the first of two poster sessions where FAMEous students presented their amazing looking posters!
