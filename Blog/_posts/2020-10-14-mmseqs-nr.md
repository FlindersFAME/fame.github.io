title: Searching the NR database with MMSeqs2
author: Rob Edwards
---

We have a computational problem searching the Non-Redundant database, but we can solve that!

If you use MMSeqs2 to search the NR database, it needs about 1.75TB of RAM (that is approximate!). Our Flinders deepthought cluster has several nodes with 2.5TB RAM so at most you can run three concurrent jobs searching the database. However, database searches are completely independent: the scores you get for one pair of sequences are independent from all the other sequences in the database.

---

Our solution is to split the database into smaller pieces, and then we can use those across more nodes of the cluster. 


# Download the NR database

Step 1, download the preformatted NR database using `mmseqs2`


```bash
mkdir --parents NR
mmseqs databases --threads 8 NR NR/NR (mktemp -d)
```


This will download the non-redundant database into the directory `NR` and the database will be called `NR`.

# Split the database

Let's split that database into many smaller chunks. From my tests it appears that 50 chunks requires about 50-60 GB RAM per compute, and 100 chunks requires about 25 GB RAM per compute.

```bash
CHUNKS=100
mkdir NR.split.$CHUNKS
cd NR.split.$CHUNKS
cut -f 1 ../NR/NR.index > ids.txt
split -n l/$CHUNKS --numeric-suffixes=1 --suffix-length=3 ids.txt
for N in $(seq 1 $CHUNKS); do
        echo $N;
        X="000$N";
        X="x${X:(-3)}";
        mkdir NR.$N
        mmseqs createsubdb $X ../NR/NR NR.$N/NR;
        mmseqs createsubdb $X ../NR/NR_h NR.$N/NR_h;
done
rm -f x???
```

(Hint: this works quite well as a slurm script!)

There are now 1 directory called `NR.split.100` and within that there are 100 directories called `NR.1`, `NR.2`, `NR.3`, ... `NR.100`.

# Search against all the directories

We can now use a slurm array job to search against all of those:


```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Search the NR using an array job.                           #

#                                                             #

# change this to point to the output from `mmseqs createdb` on your data:

mmseqs convertalis --threads 24 $QUERY NR.split.$CHUNKS/NR.$NR/NR $QUERY.nr.$CHUNKS.$NR.db $QUERY.nr.$CHUNKS.$NR.m8
```


You can save this file as `nr_chunks.slurm`, edit the line with the QUERY location, and submit 100 MMSeqs2 jobs as an array job (using `sbatch --array=1-100:1 ./nr_chunks.slurm`). You now have 2,400 processors computing on your search, and each 24 processors is only consuming 25 GB RAM.
