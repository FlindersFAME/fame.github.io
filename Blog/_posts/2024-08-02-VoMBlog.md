### Viruses of Microbes 2024 

For the first time, the Viruses of Microbes (VoM) conference set foot in Australia, and what a fantastic choice it was! From July 15th to 19th, 2024, the picturesque city of Cairns welcomed scientists from around the globe, all eager to share and discover the latest in bacteriophages, archaeal viruses, and viruses of microbial eukaryotes. And guess what? The FAME lab was there in full force, ready to showcase their groundbreaking research and soak up the tropical vibes.

#### Highlights from the FAME Lab

**Vijini Mallawarachchi** started off the Bioinformatics and New Research Avenues session with an impressive presentation on Phables, a cutting-edge tool designed to assemble high-quality bacteriophage genomes. For those of you interested in diving deeper, you can check out her work on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Vini2/phables).

**Rob Edwards** was the last and invited speaker for this session. He presented on the topic “Expanding Out Viral Bioinformatic Frontiers,” showcasing his amazing contributions to understanding bacteriophages and the ongoing research in FAME lab.

**Susie Grigson** was the other FAME lab member who gave a memorable presentation on predicting phage protein complexes, all wrapped up in an incredible LEGO-themed display. It wasn’t just educational; it was a visual treat!

The poster session was absolutely buzzing with energy, all thanks to the fantastic contributions from **Anita Tarasenko, Abbey Hutton, Bhavya Papudeshi, Clarice Harker, George Bouras**, and **Ryan Hesse**. The topics covered everything from the fascinating world of phages infecting pathogens like Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia to the isolation of phages from IBD samples. We also had the chance to dive into two incredible bioinformatic tools: Phold (https://github.com/gbouras13/phold), a phage annotation tool using protein structures, and Sphae (https://github.com/linsalrob/sphae), a phage toolkit. To top it off, there were posters on prophages and even shark viromes!

Their work drew plenty of interest and sparked many engaging discussions. It's always a thrill to see such a lively exchange of ideas and curiosity.

### Shining Stars and Big Wins

The FAME lab wasn't just participating—they were winning! A massive congratulations to **Susie Grigson**, who not only bagged the Best Oral Presentation by a PhD/Post-Doc but also wowed everyone at the Phage Bites symposium, earning her the Best Talk award there too. Susie’s double triumph secured her a spot at the ECR session at VoM, and we couldn't be prouder. Go, Susie!

### Behind the Scenes and Special Contributions

FAME's very own **Prof Rob Edwards** played a significant role on the scientific program committee, helping shape the fantastic lineup of presentations and workshops. 

Meanwhile, **PhD student Laura Inglis** took on a leadership role as part of the Early Career Researchers Committee, ensuring that the next generation of scientists had a voice and platform at the event.

### Beyond the Conference: A Tropical Getaway

But it wasn’t all work and no play. After an inspiring week of science, many FAME lab members took the opportunity to unwind and explore the natural wonders surrounding Cairns. From the stunning Great Barrier Reef to the lush expanse of the world's oldest rainforest, the team soaked up the beauty and adventure of this unique region. It was the perfect balance of learning, networking, and relaxation.
