Paparazzi spotted FAMEous researchers at Australian Society of Microbiology in Brisbane. Professor Dinsdale chaired the shark infested Environmental Microbes session with presentations by Post-doc Mike Doane and PhD students Emma Kerr and Ryan Hesse. Mike shared how microbial communities on the epidermis of tiger sharks vary across years but maintain network structure over time. Emma shared how different hosts and body sites affect microbial communities of sharks and rays. Ryan used flow cytometry to describe the viromes of healthy and wounded skin. Post-doc Nick Falk’s presentation described how microbes can be supervillains in mines by exacerbating acidic conditions or superheroes by precipitating toxic metals out of the watershed. Professor Edwards gave a great presentation on his lab’s recent phantastic bioinformatics tools. Dinsdale lab undergraduate Axel Kingston presented a poster describing the growth rates of shark bacteria at different temperatures and how this may affect sharks in warmer waters.
