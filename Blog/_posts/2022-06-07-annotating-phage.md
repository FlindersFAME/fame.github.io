# Annotating phage for therapeutics

Rob is giving a talk at [ESCMID](https://www.escmid.org/fileadmin/src/media/PDFs/1Dates_Events/event_flyers/ESGNTA_Course22_web.pdf) entitled "The annotation of therapeutic phages" where he discusses some of the issues that come up. This blog post accompanies that talk and provides links to some of the papers that he discusses.



# Host lifestyle prediction

It is generally accepted that lysogeny is bad for therapeutic phages. It can lead to superinfection exclusion, recombination with other phages, and the development of phage resistance. Here are some tools that can be used to predict whether phages are lytic or lysogenic
