Last week, Elizabeth Dinsdale joined Ashley Hagen at the American Society for Microbiology on a podcast episode of Meet
the Microbiologist! Liz chatted about various shark species and how epidermal microbiome samples are collected 
from each of these species. Liz also discusses how shotgun metagenomics is being used to characterise the structure of 
the microbiome and the functions these microbes are providing to the hosts.
