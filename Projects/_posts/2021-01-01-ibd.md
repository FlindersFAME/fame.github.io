excerpt: Understanding the role of Bacteriophages in IBD 
---

FAME is part of a large international consortium investigating the microbiome's role in Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD);
specifically Chron's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC).
Rob Edwards has joined forces with experts from Cambridge Hospital in the UK, and San Diego State University and 
Washington University in St. Louis in the United States.

The consortium will sequence and analyse hundreds of samples from healthy and IBD case individuals. 
FAME's role is to identify and investigate the bacteriophages associated with CD and UC, and to contribute to the 
development of a specialised pipeline for classifying viral and phage sequences from metagenomic samples.

For more information on this project please contact Rob Edwards.
