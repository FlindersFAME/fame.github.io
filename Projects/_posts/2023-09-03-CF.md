At FAME, we have established a collaborative partnership with respiratory physicians at the Womenâ€™s and Children's Hospital and Royal Adelaide Hospital in South Australia generating microbial metagenomic profiles of people with Cystic Fibrosis. Our multidisciplinary team is committed to integrating microbiome research with clinical practice by utilising DNA sequencing and clinical data to investigate microbial communities' role in disease progression. Together, we aim to contribute to developing more personalised and effective interventions to improve the lives of those affected by cystic fibrosis and other respiratory-related conditions.
