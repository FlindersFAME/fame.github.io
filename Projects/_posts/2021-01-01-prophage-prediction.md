excerpt: With the new release of Phispy2, we present a framework for prophage prediction software comparison

Prophages are viruses that are integrated into bacterial genomes. A few computatational biologists are keen to identify 
those specific regions, because they are more interesting than the rest of the genome. This project aims to present a 
FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data resource for comparing prophage prediction software.
