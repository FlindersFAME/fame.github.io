            Our metagenomics research projects investigate the microbiomes and viromes in diseases like Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and Cystic Fibrosis (CF). These studies will the genetic diversity of these microbial communities and enable the development of novel treatment strategies such as phage therapy.

            At FAME, we are utilising metagenomics and eDNA to uncover the human impacts on environmental microbiomes. This includes a wide variety of environmental projects from the protective viruses within shark mucosa to the impact of mining on waterway microbiomes.

            Sequencing technology and the volume of publically-available sequencing data is progressing at a staggering rate. This vast ocean of oppurtunity requires equally impressive computing infrastructure to analyse. At FAME, we have partnered with HPC centres across Australia to mine this vast resource to identify novel microbes.

            Novel problems require novel solutions. Our projects are at the cutting-edge of metagenomics research and as such, off-the-shelf solutions are rarely available for processing and analysing our unique data. Following best-practices for software development, we have generated a suite of Bioinformatics software which are freely available for all to use.
