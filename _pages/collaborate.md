Do you have a Microbiome or Metagenome problem? We're here to help!

The goal of the Flinders Accelerator for Microbiome Exploration is to facilitate your journey into the world of 
microbiomes and other nucleotide-based analyses, and to enhance metagenomics and microbiome studies across Flinders. 
The Flinders Accelerator for Microbiome Exploration is requesting proposals to enable microbiome analysis. We will 
provide financial and technical support, working in collaboration with you to generate preliminary data that can support 
a grant application or publication.
