## Discovery of novel phages with therapuetic applications

The FAME lab has developed collaborations with SA pathology, discovering new phage for Stenotrophomonas and Achromobacter strains infecting Cystic fibrosis patients.

Our mission is to apply this newly discovered phage to patients across Australia, helping to alleviate the bacterial burden in their lungs and improve patient health and outcomes.

Our team includes Professor Robert Edwards, Dr Morgyn Warner, Dr, Sarah Giles, Clarice Cram, and Will Plewa. Our collection so far includes 54 bacterial strain from cystic fibrosis patients and ten newly identified phages currently being investigated for their potential in phage therapy.

## Viruses & Irritable Bowel Diseases

FAME is part of a large international consortium investigating the microbiome's role in Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD); specifically Chron's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). In this NIH-funded project, Rob Edwards and Elizabeth Dinsdale has joined forces with experts from Cambridge Hospital in the UK, and San Diego State University and Washington University in St. Louis in the United States.

The consortium will sequence and analyse hundreds of samples from healthy and IBD case individuals.  FAME's role is to identify and investigate the bacteriophages associated with CD and UC, and to contribute to the  development of a specialised pipeline for classifying viral and phage sequences from metagenomic samples.

## Making Metagenomics Measurable

This project aims to revolutionize our view of the microbial world once more by transforming microbiome studies from relative counts of organisms to actual numbers of microbes. This project expects to impact all the microbiome studies that are being performed worldwide by unveiling the actual numbers of microbes. Expected outcomes of this project include new techniques to enumerate the number of bacteria in different environments and new approaches to measure gene expression within individual bacteria in any environment that will be demonstrated with complex microbial communities. This should provide significant benefits because microbes affect every aspect of our lives and those effects are driven by how many microbes are present.

## Microbiomes of Cystic Fibrosis in South Australia

At FAME, we have established a collaborative partnership with respiratory physicians at the Womenâ€™s and Children's 
Hospital and Royal Adelaide Hospital in South Australia generating microbial metagenomic profiles of people with 
Cystic Fibrosis.

Our multidisciplinary team is committed to integrating microbiome research with clinical practice 
by utilising DNA sequencing and clinical data to investigate microbial communities' role in disease progression. 
Together, we aim to contribute to developing more personalised and effective interventions to improve the lives 
of those affected by cystic fibrosis and other respiratory-related conditions.
