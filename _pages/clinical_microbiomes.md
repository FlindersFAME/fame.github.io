## Viruses & Irritable Bowel Diseases

FAME is part of a large international consortium investigating the microbiome's role in Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD);
specifically Chron's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC).
Rob Edwards and Elizabeth Dinsdale has joined forces with experts from Cambridge Hospital in the UK, and San Diego State
University and Washington University in St. Louis in the United States.

The consortium will sequence and analyse hundreds of samples from healthy and IBD case individuals. 
FAME's role is to identify and investigate the bacteriophages associated with CD and UC, and to contribute to the 
development of a specialised pipeline for classifying viral and phage sequences from metagenomic samples.

For more information on this project please contact Rob Edwards and Elizabeth Dinsdale.

## Microbiomes of Cystic Fibrosis in South Australia

At FAME, we have established a collaborative partnership with respiratory physicians at the Womenâ€™s and Children's 
Hospital and Royal Adelaide Hospital in South Australia generating microbial metagenomic profiles of people with 
Cystic Fibrosis. Our multidisciplinary team is committed to integrating microbiome research with clinical practice 
by utilising DNA sequencing and clinical data to investigate microbial communities' role in disease progression. 
Together, we aim to contribute to developing more personalised and effective interventions to improve the lives 
of those affected by cystic fibrosis and other respiratory-related conditions.
