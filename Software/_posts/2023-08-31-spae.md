Phage toolkit to detect and assemble phage candidates for phage therapy. Snakemake workflow using Snaketool to assemble and annotate phage sequences.<!--more-->

This snakemake workflow was built using [Snaketool](https://github.com/beardymcjohnface/Snaketool), to assemble and annotate phage sequences. Currently this tool is being developed for phage genomes. THe steps include

 - QC using [Trimanammi](https://github.com/beardymcjohnface/Trimnami)
 - Assembly, either [SPAdes](https://github.com/ablab/spades) or [Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye)
 - Contig quality checks
   - Read coverage using [Koverage](https://github.com/beardymcjohnface/Koverage)
   - Verify they are viral contigs using [ViralVerify](https://github.com/ablab/viralVerify)
   - Completeness using [CheckV](https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/CheckV)
   - Assembly graph compnents check - internal script This results in determining if the phage genome was assembled
 - Annotation of the phage genome using [Pharokka](https://github.com/gbouras13/pharokka)
