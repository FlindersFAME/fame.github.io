PHANOTATE is a tool to annotate phage genomes.<!--more--> It uses the assumption that non-coding bases in a phage genome 
is disadvantageous, and then populates a weighted graph to find the optimal path through the six frames of the DNA where 
open reading frames are beneficial paths, while gaps and overlaps are penalized paths.
