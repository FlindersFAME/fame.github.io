The pipeline is the brainchild of Scott Handley and his group at Washington University in St. Louis:

_"A hecatomb is a great sacrifice; a great number of people, animals or things, especially as sacrificed or destroyed. 
In this case we provide a hecatomb of false-positive viral sequences."_

Rob and I have been working with Scott to help finish development of the pipeline and it has recently seen a number of 
quality of life improvements. The pipeline runs via Snakemake and [Snaketool](https://github.com/beardymcjohnface/Snaketool), 
utilising Conda/Mamba for ease of installation and use, as well as improved scalability and robustness. 
The pipeline now has scripts for downloading and installing the databases and adding new host genomes. 
A convenience launcher has also been included to make running these jobs super simple.
