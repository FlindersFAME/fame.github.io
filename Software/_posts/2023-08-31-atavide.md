Atavide is a simple, yet complete workflow for metagenomics data analysis, including QC/QA, optional host removal, 
assembly and cross-assembly, and individual read based annotations. We have also built in some advanced analytics 
including tools to assign annotations from reads to contigs, and to generate metagenome-assembled genomes in several 
different ways, giving you the power to explore your data!

atavide is 100% snakemake and conda, so you only need to install the snakemake workflow, and then everything else will 
be installed with conda.
