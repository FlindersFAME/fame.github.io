While there are tools that will calculate read-coverage statistics, they do not scale particularly well for large datasets, large sample numbers, or large reference FASTAs. 
Koverage is designed to place minimal burden on I/O and RAM to allow for maximum scalability.

Koverage is another pipeline built on the [Snaketool](https://github.com/beardymcjohnface/Snaketool) framework using Snakemake.
It is incredibly easy to install and run and offers several methods for generating coverage statistics to suit your needs.
Koverage utilises [MetaSnek](https://github.com/beardymcjohnface/metasnek) for parsing fastq reads and is able to 
correctly identify all paried and single end sequencing files, from either a directory or TSV sample manifest input.
Furthermore, it is designed for interoperability with other Snaketool and Snakemake pipelines and has been incorporated into
numerous FAME pipelines such as Hecatomb, Spae, and Phables.
