Phables is a tool developed to resolve bacteriophage genomes using phage bubbles in viral metagenomic data. <!--more-->
It models cyclic phage-like components in the viral metagenomic assembly as flow networks, models as a minimum flow decomposition problem and resolves genomic paths corresponding to flow paths determined. Phables uses the [Minimum Flow Decomposition via Integer Linear Programming](https://github.com/algbio/MFD-ILP) implementation to obtain the flow paths.

Phables was motivated by a highly successful assembly-graph-based tool for metagenomic binning named [GraphBin](https://github.com/metagentools/GraphBin) to leverage connectivity information to recover bacteriophage-like components from assembly graphs and identify genomic paths.
