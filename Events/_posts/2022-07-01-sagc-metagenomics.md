The second metagenomics workshop hosted by FAME and SAGC took place in July in the Flinders Victoria Square building. There were several days of hands-on activities and the material is freely available on the [Workshop website](https://bioinf.cc/workshop2022/). Following several days of intense staring at a computer monitor, we decided to unwind with a wonderful afternoon at the Adelaide TreeClimb.
