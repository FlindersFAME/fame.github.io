FAME PhD students Ryan Hesse (President) and Emma Kerr have rebooted FUMBA. The club is dedicated to facilitating science communication with monthly guest speakers sharing their experience in marine science and shedding light on their career paths. The club also hosts networking events and the essential annual pub crawl. The club also helped facilitate the first annual Ocean Science Day open house event. FUMBA has created a community of passionate marine biologists. You can learn more about the club and upcoming events on our Instagram page @fumbafuaa.
