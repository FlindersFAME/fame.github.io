Women in Science and Engineering at Flinders is the newest student club at Flinders University. Led by FAME Lab Ladies Emma Kerr (President) Laura Inglis (Vice President) and Abbey Hutton (Secretary) WiSE Flinders is a supportive community for women in STEM. Since its inception in May, the club has accumulated over 60 members, spanning all degrees. We have already hosted a professional headshots event where members could get a new photo for their LinkedIn or GoogleScholar profiles. During Semester 2 WiSE will be hosting a research networking night, members breakfast, a science communication workshop, and several wellness social events. You can be a part of the club by visiting our instagram page @wise_flinders or joining us at our next meeting. If you have any questions about the club, you can send us an email at [wiseflinders@gmail.com](mailto:wiseflinders@gmail.com).
