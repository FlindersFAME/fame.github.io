The Adelaide Women in Bioinformatics meetup started in 2021 and is now a quarterly meeting. The events are generally informal serving as a platform for networking, knowledge sharing and professional development in bioinformatics. This event is generally hosted at Flinders University’s Victoria Square campus, leveraging the university’s convenient and accessible location and encouraging broader participation across South Australian universities. The event is generally sponsored by Flinders Women in STEM, providing snacks for these meetups. This enhances attendees' overall experience and reinforces the importance of these meetups as catalysts for empowering women in bioinformatics.
