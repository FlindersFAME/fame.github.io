We had the privilege of welcoming CSIRO’s Young Indigenous Women's STEM Academy to Flinders University for a marine biology workshop. The FAME lab and Southern Shark Ecology Group (SSEG) teamed up to share the importance of molecular and biochemical techniques for shark and ray conservation. SSEG Dr. Lauren Meyer and PhD student Chloe Roberts showcased shark and ray diversity. Students were able to get hands on with shark jaws and learn about the diets of South Australian shark species. FAME’s Dr. Belinda Martin, Dr. Jessica Carlson-Jones, and PhD student Emma Kerr led students through an investigation of stingray residency on the coast of South Australia. Students used mock environmental DNA samples to assess the presence of southern eagle rays along the Adelaide coast. We would like to thank all the young women who came along and Jess Stimson and Charlie Griffiths for their collaboration.
