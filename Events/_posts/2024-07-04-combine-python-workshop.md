In today's bioinformatics landscape, it is crucial to master Python. Its flexibility and extensive library support, including Biopython, NumPy, and Pandas, make it indispensable for streamlining data analysis, sequence alignment, and statistical computations. Recognizing the importance of these skills, we recently hosted a one-day Python workshop to equip participants with foundational programming knowledge to support their research endeavors.

The workshop, organized by COMBINE and FAME—two organizations renowned for their successful workshops in Adelaide—provided an immersive introduction to Python programming. On June 27th, Prof. Rob Edwards, Director of FAME, led a one-day Python workshop, drawing 30 participants from Flinders University, UniSA, University of Adelaide, SAHMRI, SAiGENCI, and SA Water. Prof. Edwards guided participants through essential concepts, emphasizing practical applications and integrating bioinformatics tools. The agenda covered Python basics, data manipulation with Pandas, and automating genomic data analysis, ensuring a comprehensive learning experience.

Feedback from the participants was overwhelmingly positive. Many praised Prof. Edwards for his engaging teaching style, noting his deep knowledge, the well-paced delivery, and the practical examples he used to illustrate complex concepts. Participants appreciated the clarity and relevance of the content, which was directly applicable to their bioinformatics challenges. This event underscores our commitment to enhancing bioinformatics education and fostering community growth.
