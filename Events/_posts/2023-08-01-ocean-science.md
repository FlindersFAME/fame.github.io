Flinders University marine labs came together to share their love of science during our first annual Ocean Science Day open house. As part of National Science Week the Dinsdale, Huveneers, Baring, Hesp and Beheregaray, labs put together themed activities to showcase their research areas. We also welcomed Exploring Marine Sanctuaries and Seacliff Surf Life Saving Club to Bedford Park. EMS shared virtual reality underwater experiences and the Seacliff SLSC shared water safety information and first aid demonstrations. Flinders University Underwater Club and Flinders University Marine Biology Association provided valuable community connections to current and prospective Flinders students. The Dinsdale lab guided participants through using supersuckers to collect microbiome samples from inflatable sharks. We also shared the coolest microbial adaptations at our Make-Your-Own-Microbe station. The public got to interact with live marine invertebrates in the touch tank exhibit, see a live-action wave demonstration, and more. We reached about 300 people including pre-school, primary and high school students, their parents, and even a few grandparents. The event drew several prospective Flinders students curious about future courses and several prospective honours students who got to chat with potential supervisors. Everyone who came was enthusiastic and we got great positive feedback from visitors.
