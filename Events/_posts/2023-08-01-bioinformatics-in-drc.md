In July 2023, Professor Robert Edwards and Professor Elizabeth Dinsdale travelled to the Democratic Republic of Congo to teach a bioinformatic workshop. The workshop included a particular focus on students who were dedicated to studying infectious diseases. They had already conducted DNA sequencing.
