In July 2023, Professor Robert Edwards and Professor Elizabeth Dinsdale travelled to the Democratic Republic of Congo to teach a bioinformatic workshop. The workshop included a particular focus on students who were dedicated to studying infectious diseases. They had already conducted DNA sequencing. With the guidance and tutorials from the workshop, the students began examining the DNA sequences.
