I'm currently a PhD student. I did my bachelor degree in science (marine biology) and spent my honours trying to refine 
qPCR protocols for detecting the OSHV-1 virus in Pacific oysters. My PhD work is focused on creating a controlled 
vocabulary for bacterial isolation sources and using algorithms along with the vocabulary to predict where a given 
metagenome sample was isolated from.
