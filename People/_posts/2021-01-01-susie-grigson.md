Susie Grigson is a PhD student in the Edwards lab. 
She has a strong interest in bioinformatics and completed undergraduate degrees in molecular biology and mathematics. 
In 2021, Susie completed Honours in Microbial Ecology where she used laboratory experiments, bioinformatics, 
and mathematical modelling to investigate the migration of microbial communities over several metres.  

Susieâ€™s PhD research will combine her skills in biology and mathematics to develop probabilistic genome annotation 
models for annotating viral proteins with unknown function.
