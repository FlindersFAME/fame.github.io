Jess has an interest in collaborating with clinicians on combining clinical data with metagenomic sequencing to 
understand the role the microbiome plays in health and disease. Her background includes using flow cytometry and 
metagenomics to quantify and identify the bacteria and viruses involved in respiratory related conditions. 
This has included chronic rhinosinusitis, paediatric sleep disorder breathing, and cystic fibrosis. 
It is hoped that these techniques will improve and redefine the way pathogens are screened for and monitored in 
response to treatment in the future.
