Jody McKerral (Fisher) has a background in applied mathematics but has a strong interest in interdisciplinary problems. 
She has investigated a range of biophysics related problems, and particularly focuses on emergent properties and how 
physical laws constrain biological systems. Her research includes the role turbulence plays in structuring ecosystem
dynamics, assembly rules of microbiomes, and the geometric biasing of diffusion. She undertook a Fulbright placement 
during her PhD with Albert-László Barabási at the Centre for Complex Network Research in Boston (Northeastern 
University), using networks to look at universal properties of microbiomes. Jody is presently a research associate in 
the Flinders Accelerator for Microbiome Exploration (FAME) laboratory.
