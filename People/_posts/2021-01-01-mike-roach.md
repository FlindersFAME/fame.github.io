Iâ€™m a Research Associate (bioinformatician) at the new Flinders Accelerator for Microbiome Exploration.
My PhD was in drug discovery and protein structural bioinformatics, and I transitioned to genomics when I started my 
first post-doc at the Australian Wine Research Institute. My current role involves all things bioinformatics and 
metagenomics with a particular interest in bacteriophages.
