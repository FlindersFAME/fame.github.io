After completing my undergraduate degree in biotechnology, I begun research as part of the FAME labs at Flinders, working with viruses and high-risk bacteria. My project specifically involves the optimization of lysogenic bacteriophage (phage) induction, providing the foundation for further research. Results from this project may inform further work regarding exploratory phage induction studies, with a focus on rapidly screening a range of experimental compounds. While my personal academic interests are many and varied, this project provides a fantastic introduction into the academic application of various laboratory techniques and bioinformatic workflows.
