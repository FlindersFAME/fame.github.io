excerpt: "Honours student in the Dinsdale lab\n"
---

Having finished my Bachelor of Science (Marine Biology) in 2020 I am now a current Honours student under the supervision 
of Elizabeth Dinsdale and Lauren Meyer. 
My project involves analysing the heavy metal load in skin and muscle samples of different shark species then, 
comparing this data to the presence of heavy metal related genes found in the epidermal microbiome of the same sharks 
to see if there is any correlation. 
The species involved in the study are tiger, dusky, and Galapagos sharks that were sampled off the coast of Norfolk 
Island. The study is scheduled to be submitted in May 2022.
