Which microbes become abundant in polluted environments and what genetic pathways do they use to break down contaminants? That question kept me busy during the first half of my PhD. My next question is about how phages occur in the environment, for example preferred biomes or preferred co-occurrences with microbes. My "home" group is the Theoretical Biology and Bioinformatics group at Utrecht University.
