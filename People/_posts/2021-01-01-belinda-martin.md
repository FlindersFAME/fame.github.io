I have a background in forensic biology with a focus on trace DNA analysis using novel analytical approaches
to obtain more genetic data from less starting material. My research includes the design and optimisation of 
PCR assays for Y-STR analysis and the genetic sequencing of various targets from human DNA samples that have
undergone extreme conditions. Following recent collaborations and an introduction to the FAME lab, through my
work on the forensic application of eDNA from soil, I joined the team in early 2022 and am excited to step into 
the world of microbiome analysis and be involved with FAMEâ€™s multidisciplinary culture.
