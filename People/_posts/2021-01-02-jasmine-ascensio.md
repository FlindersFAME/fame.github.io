Hi I'm Jasmine, and am studying for a Marine Biology Bachelors degree. Currently working in Dinsdale lab to investigate tolerance of Port Jackson (Heterodontus portusjacksoni) shark-associated microbes. I am interested in studying the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of epidermal microbes associated with the Port Jackson shark and examining how this resistance may vary under different pH levels and temperature conditions.
