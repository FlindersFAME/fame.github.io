I am currently a PhD student in Rob Edwards' lab. <!--more--> I have an undergraduate degree in Biotechnology and did my 
Masters degree in Bioinformatics. During my masters program my research focused on assembling metagenome assembled 
genomes. My PhD work will focus on studying the role of bacteriophage populations in microbiome datasets.
