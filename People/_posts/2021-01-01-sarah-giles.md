I currently hold the position of Postdoctoral Research Associate as part of the FAME laboratory at Flinders University. 
I completed my Ph.D. in early 2020, my thesis focused on the StkRS two-component signal transduction system and its 
association with resistance mechanisms of the nosocomial pathogen _Acinetobacter baumannii_. Since then, my focus has 
shifted to encompass everything Phage related, this research includes working with samples from IBD and cancer patients, 
as well as sewage and seawater.
