Hi my name is Evan, I'm currently completing my degree in Molecular Biosciences, with an aim to start honours in the 
middle of 2021. My current volunteer work is focused on refining the process of virome extraction from faecal 
samples. This will aid in the study of the human gut virome, and further increase the understanding of how viruses 
impact human health, by providing more complete viromes for metagenomic analysis.
