excerpt: "PhD student in the Dinsdale lab\n"

I'm Ryan Hesse, a PhD student working for Dr. Liz Dinsdale in the Flinders Accelerator for Microbiome Exploration. 
I did my bachelor's degree in Marine Biology at Long Beach State University, 
where I studied the interactions between giant kelp and their epifaunal communities and the competitive interactions 
between fire corals and gorgonian soft corals. 
I then did a master's degree with Dr. Dinsdale at San Diego State University where I focused on the epidermal viromes 
of carcharhinid sharks. 
My current work is centered on expanding that shark virome project to include the epidermal microbiome of those sharks, 
the phage-microbe interactions that occur in their epidermal mucus, and how those dynamics vary over time.
