I'm a microbiology graduate deeply passionate about infectious diseases, virology, and the broader implications of microbiology in shaping public health. I'm particularly captivated by the challenges of antimicrobial resistance and the key role of stewardship in its containment. During my honours year, I am focusing on isolating and characterising bacteriophages. The intent is to explore their potential as therapeutic agents, specifically targeting opportunistic pathogens associated with chronic lung infections in individuals with Cystic Fibrosis.
