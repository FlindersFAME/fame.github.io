excerpt: "Honours student in the Dinsdale lab\n"
---

In 2020 I graduated with a Bachelor of Science (Marine Biology) and will be conducting my Honours under Elizabeth 
Dinsdale throughout 2022. 
The specifics of the project are still to be finalised, but we hope to look at a possible association between the 
microbiome of shark species and their physical organs. 
Potential target species for the study include either Port Jackson sharks or gummy sharks. 
I aim to complete my project in November of 2022.
