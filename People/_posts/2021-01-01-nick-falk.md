excerpt: "Research Associate in Microbiome Research in the Dinsdale lab\n"
---

Nick is a Postdoctoral Research Associate working in the Dinsdale lab. 
His interests are rooted in linking microbial diversity and function to biogeochemical cycling in natural and impacted systems. 
A graduate of the Great Lakes Institute for Environmental Research (GLIER) at the University of Windsor, Ontario, Canada, 
his work recognizes the importance of freshwater security in the face of multiple and combining stressors from agricultural, industrial, and urban sources. 
With FAME, Nick will be seeking connections between key microbial genes and gene pathways that influence and are influenced by the mining landscape, 
with a focus on Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) geochemistry.
