Vijini is a Research Associate in Bioinformatics at the Flinders Accelerator for Microbiome Exploration (FAME). Her research interests include metagenomics, algorithms, data science and machine learning. She completed her PhD in Computer Science at the Australian National University in 2022, and her thesis is focused on developing computational models and algorithms for improved binning of metagenomic data. She has developed several metagenomic analysis tools which have leveraged assembly graphs to recover bacterial genomes from metagenomes. Currently, her research at FAME focuses on developing methods to recover viral genomes from metagenomes which can facilitate the discovery of novel bacteriophages.
