Vijini is currently a Research Associate in Bioinformatics at the Flinders Accelerator for Microbiome Exploration (FAME). 
She completed her Ph.D. in 2022 and her thesis focused on algorithms and computational models related to metagenomics binning. 
Her research studied how the assembly graph can be incorporated to bin metagenomic contigs and she has developed several 
metagenomic binning tools including [GraphBin](https://github.com/Vini2/GraphBin) and [MetaCoAG](https://github.com/Vini2/MetaCoAG). 
Her interests include bioinformatics, metagenomics, algorithms and machine learning.
