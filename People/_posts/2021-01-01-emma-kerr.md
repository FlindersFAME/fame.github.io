excerpt: "PhD student in the Dinsdale lab\n"
---

I am a PhD student in the Dinsdale lab. I graduated magna cum laude from San Diego State University with a Bachelor of Science in Biology/Ecology from the Weber Honors College. I am the President of the student group Women in Science and Engineering at Flinders. I also serve as the student representative of the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Action Group for the College of Science and Engineering.  

My PhD research will focus on stingray microbiomes in South Australia. I am interested in how host factors like body site (skin, gills or cloaca), denticle structure or protein expression affect the microbiome of benthic sharks.
