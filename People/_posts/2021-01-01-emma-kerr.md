I  am a PhD student in the Dinsdale lab and have just moved to Australia from California. 
I graduated from San Diego State University with a Bachelor of Science in Biology/Ecology
as part of the Weber Honors College. During my undergraduate, I completed an Honors thesis
on phylosymbiosis in stingray microbiomes. My PhD research will focus on stingray microbiomes
in Australia and how their microbiome may vary between host phylogeny.
