excerpt: "Honours student in the Dinsdale lab\n"

In 2021 I graduated my double degree of Archaeology and Biodiversity and Conservation and am currently
conducting my Honours under Elizabeth Dinsdale throughout 2022. My Honour's project aims to compare the 
different microbiomes that are present on the skin of Tiger, Dusky and Galapagos sharks around the Norfolk 
island. I aim to complete my project by November 2022.
