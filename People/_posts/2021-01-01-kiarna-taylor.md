excerpt: "Honours student in the Dinsdale lab\n"

In 2022, I completed a Bachelor of Science (Biodiversity and Conservation) and have progressed into Honours as a part of 
the Dinsdale Lab. The primary focus of my project is to characterize the Heterodontus portusjacksoni (Port Jackson 
shark) dorsal and ventral epidermal microbiome which contain different denticle textures. Whether dermal denticles or 
epithelial mucus functions are the major structuring component of the epidermal microbiome remains an outstanding 
question, making this an exciting opportunity to further shark microbiome research. I have a love and passion for the 
environment and aspire to be involved in microbiome research to determine health and diagnose disease within marine 
species and ecosystems.
