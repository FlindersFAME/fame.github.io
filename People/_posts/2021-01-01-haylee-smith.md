excerpt: "Honours student in the Dinsdale lab\n"
---

After completing my Bachelor of Science (Biotechnology), I became an honours student in Dinsdale lab. 
I knew I was interested in Liz's work, so I decided to take on the project looking at heavy metal 
contamination in mine site water outflow. This was an exciting opportunity for me as the project 
encompassed geomicrobiology, earth science and bioinformatics - all fields that sparked my interest. 
I love the outdoors, free coffee and op shopping! I'm really excited to publish my thesis and help 
inform greener mining practices for generations to come.
