My research uses genomics to investigate the biodiversity and ecology of microbes and viruses on coral reefs, kelp 
forest and shark epidermis.<!--more--> I am interested in understanding how microbial and viral function responds to environmental 
pressures and affects the health of the host and ecosystem. I have developed novel tools, undergraduate education 
programs and international workshops to analyze metagenomics data and understand the structure of host microbiomes. I 
demonstrated that the functional attributes of microbial and viral metagenomes could distinguish across biomes.
