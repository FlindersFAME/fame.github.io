excerpt: "Honours student in the Dinsdale lab and FAME Webmaster\n"

I recently graduated from a Bachelor of Science (Forensic Analytical Biological Science) and have since started my 
Honours under the supervision of Elizabeth Dinsdale.
My project involves looking at the Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAGs) of whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) from the 
Philippines, and how the skin microbiome fluctuates in each of the 21 individuals across time. 
I aim to complete my project ready for thesis submission in March of 2022.
