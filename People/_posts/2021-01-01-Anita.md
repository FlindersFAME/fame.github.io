excerpt: "Honours student in the Edwards lab\n"

In 2022, I completed a Bachelor of Science (Biotechnology) degree and subsequently embarked on an Honours program as part of the Edwards Lab. The primary objective of my research is to expand our understanding of the interactions between Acinetobacter baumannii bacteria and bacteriophages. My research involves the exploration of the receptors located on the surface of Acinetobacter and the mechanisms governing their entry into host cells. Furthermore, my study entails the isolation of host bacterial phages. These phages will be rigorously screened against a library of bacterial mutants, including those harbouring modifications in efflux pump systems.
