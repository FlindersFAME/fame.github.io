I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Animal behaviour at Flinders University in 2022, where I did a research report on shark skin microbiome with Prof. Elizabeth Dinsdale. 
I am currently doing my Masters in Biotechnology, at Flinders University, and I am continuing to research Elasmobranch(shark) microbiome for my graduation thesis. My thesis topic focuses on the antibiotic function of the Elasmobranch skin microbiome.
