I am currently a PhD student in the Flinders Accelerator for Microbiome Exploration (FAME) Lab. I completed my Bachelor's in software engineering from University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Then he pursued his master's degree in information science from University of Arkansas at Little Rock, USA with a thesis in “Automating Blog Crawling Using Pattern Recognition”. Roy’s primary area of interest is bioinformatics, and his research focuses on developing machine learning/computational models and algorithms in the field of metagenomics.
